#Review Questions for Chapter 5
#1) What is the difference between a tuple and a list?
#The primary difference between tuples and lists is that tuples are immutable as opposed to lists which are
#mutable. Therefore, it is possible to change a list but not a tuple. The contents of a tuple cannot change once
# they have been created in Python due to the immutability of tuples.
#Assignment changes variables, but mutation changes objects. Most Python objects can be changed after they've been
# created. Lists, sets, and dictionaries can all be changed, whereas tuples, numbers, and strings cannot.






#2) How is a list different than a dictionary?
#A list is an ordered sequence of objects, whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. However, the main difference
# is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position.
#Dictionary is a key and does not have an order but you cannot use same words twice.






#3) Create a program that prints a list of words in random order. The program should print all the words and
# not repeat any.
# See PyCharm help at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/

import random
list = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]
reap = []
while len(list) !=len(reap):
    #pick one word at random
    word = random.choice(list)
    if word not in reap:
        print(word)
        reap.append(word)
        #append is a modifier





# 4) Write a Character Creator program for a role-playing game. The player should be given a pool of 30 points to
# spend on four attributes: Strength, Health, Wisdom, and Dexterity. The player should be able to spend points
# from the pool on any attribute and should also be able to take points from an attribute and put them back into
# the pool.
